## GeRuMap-app
Simple java App (in a Maven framework) made for a university subject "Software design". <br>
The purpose of this project was to practice MVC app architecture and different design patterns:
1. Singleton
2. Observer
3. State pattern
4. Command pattern
5. Composite pattern
6. Factory method

This is a simple desktop application to create Mind Maps to help with studying. <br>
Maps can be gouped into projects. There are no predefined templates for the way a <br>
map can be styled but the user can create their own template, save the map as an image <br>
or save the map and continue working on it later.

### Dictionary
**Mind Map** is a structured way of showing ideas and information. They are organized <br>
around 1 central topic and have associations to different subtopics whics represent logical units.

**Topic** is usually one word which represent key words that refer to logical units of information.

**Associations** are lines between topics which create a hierarchy in the mind map.

### Options for the User
User can do the following:
- Create a project
- Create a Mind Map (optionally: choose a pattern they have created)
- Create a topic and associations on the map
- Edit the map (move the topics, edit the color and text of the elements, center the map around 1 topic)
- Import an existing map
- Export the map (create a pattern, save it as map for future work, save it as an image)


## Running the app
The recommended way is to clone the repository to your machine, open it inside a code editor <br> 
(VS Code or IntelliJ) and run the `AppCore.java` file.
