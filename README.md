MVC app architecture and different design patterns:

This is a simple desktop application to create Mind Maps to help with studying. <br>
Maps can be gouped into projects. There are no predefined templates for the way a <br>
map can be styled bt the user can create their own template, save the map as an image <br>
or save the map and continue working on it later.
